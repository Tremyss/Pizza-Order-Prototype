Story
One day around lunchtime, a black car stops in front of your office. A Sicilian guy in black coat gets out from the car with a huge black box in his hand. He walks straight into your office. Without saying anything puts the box down to a desk then head out...
Everyone freezes - fear is in their eyes...
Then you smell something... nice... melted cheese... and fresh basil... The box, the box smells like... PIZZA!
You pluck up your courage, open the box and yes! There are seven different fresh Sicilian pizzas and a letter is wait for you. The pizzas smell so good that you can't resist eat all of them.
When you pull yourself together from the rapture of the taste, you open the envelope and start to read the letter:
These are my grandma's pizzas.
I want these pizzas online!
You have one week to prove you can do it.
